Simple Scan Interface
=====================

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   from bluesky.examples import det1, det2, det3, det
   from bluesky.standard_config import gs
   from bluesky.standard_config import *  # the simple scan instances
   from bluesky.tests.utils import setup_test_run_engine
   gs.DETS = [det]
   gs.RE = setup_test_run_engine()


The simple scan interface provides a condensed syntax to execute common tasks.

Some of the names and signatures of the functions in this module closely match
some core "macros" in SPEC, control software used in X-ray diffraction
experiments. Other functions introduce new functionality.

The simple interface is not necessarily recommended for developing new scans.
It is backed by a more explicit :doc:`scans` suited for development work.

Specify Detectors
-----------------

.. note::

    If you are using a IPython profile, a list of detectors might be
    automatically specified at startup. In that case, you may not need to do
    anything unless you need to inspect or customize that list.

The setting ``gs.DETS`` is a list of a detector objects. It controls
which detectors are triggered and read by all the simple scans.
(Incidentally, ``gs`` stands for "global state" or "global settings." Why
can't it just be plain ``DETS``? Global variables are best avoided in Python,
and the ``gs.`` part provides useful input validation.)

.. ipython:: python

    gs.DETS = [det1, det2]

Like any Python list, you can append and remove elements.

.. ipython:: python

    gs.DETS.append(det3)
    gs.DETS.remove(det1)
    gs.DETS

There are other settings particular to certain kinds of scan.
They are addressed below.

Usage Example
-------------

Calling a scan generates a set of instructions and executes them. This
"count" command acquires one reading from the detectors.

.. ipython:: python

    ct()

In the standard, out-of-the-box configuration of bluesky, data is automatically saved and logged.

Out of the box, it does not print or plot the data , but live tables and plots
can be easily added. As with the detectors above, this may already be configured
in your IPython profile. Here is one way to add a table to every ``ct``
scan. (More on ``ct`` below.)

.. ipython:: python

    ct.subs = LiveTable(gs.DETS)  # Print all the detectors' readings.
    ct()

The ``subs`` attribute stands for "subscriptions", about which you can read
more in :doc:`callbacks`.

The table will appear for all future scans; it only has to be set up once.
Observe:

.. ipython:: python

    ct()

If there are many detectors and the table is too wide, you can be more
selective.

.. ipython:: python

    ct.subs = LiveTable([det2])
    ct()

Count
-----

A ``ct`` ("count") scan reads all the detectors in the list ``DETS`` for 
a given acquisition time. If no time is specified, 1 second is the default.

.. code-block:: python

    ct(time=1)

Motor Scans
-----------

Like ``ct``, the motor scans read from all the detectors in the list
``DETS``.

Absolute Scans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An ``ascan`` ("absolute scan") scans one motor in equal-sized steps.

.. code-block:: python

    ascan(motor, start, finish, intervals, time)

Note that ``intervals`` counts the number of *steps* which is one less
than the number of *data points*. This follows the convention in SPEC.
Outside of the simple API, we revert to the Python convention of counting
data points, not steps.

An ``a2scan`` scans two motors together along different trajectories,
again in equal-sized steps. (We think of this as the "inner product" of two
trajectories.)

.. code-block:: python

    a2scan(motor1, start1, finish1, motor2, start2, finish2, intervals, time)

.. code-block:: python

    a3scan(motor1, start1, finish1, motor2, start2, finish2, motor3, 
           start3, finish3, intervals, time)

We provide ``a2scan`` and ``a3scan`` for convenience, but in fact both of them
support any number of motors. This is valid:

.. code-block:: python

    a2scan(motor1, start1, finish1, motor2, start2, finish2, motor3, start3,
           finish3, motor4, start4, finish4, intervals, time)

Delta Scans
^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``dscan`` ("delta scan") scans one motor in equal-size steps, specified
relative to the motor's current position.

.. code-block:: python

    dscan(motor, start, finish, intervals, time)

``lup`` is an alias for ``dscan``. And as with ``ascan`` above, there is a
``d2scan`` and a ``d3scan``, each of which accept an unlimited number of
motors.

Mesh Scan
^^^^^^^^^

A ``mesh`` scan scans any number of motors in a mesh. (We think of this as the
"other product" of the trajectories.)

.. code-block:: python

    mesh(motor1, start1, finish1, intervals1, motor2, start2, finish2,
         intervals2, time)

As with ``a2scan`` and ``a3scan``, ``mesh`` accepts any number of motors.
Notice that the number of intervals is specified sepraately for each motor.

Scans Tied to Particular Motors / Controllers
---------------------------------------------

Theta Two Theta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This scan requires the settings ``gs.TH_MOTOR`` ("theta motor") and
``gs.TTH_MOTOR`` ("two theta motor").

A ``th2th`` ("theta two theta") scans steps the two theta motor through a
given range while stepping the theta motor through half that range.

.. code-block:: python

    th2th(start, finish, intervals, time)

Temperature Scans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Temperature scans require the setting ``gs.TEMP_CONTROLLER``.

A ``tscan`` steps the temperature controller through equally-spaced temperature
set points. An optional ``sleep`` argument specifies a thermalization time. As
in SPEC, it is zero by default.

.. code-block:: python

    tscan(start, finish, intervals, time, sleep=0)

There is also ``dtscan``, a relative temperature scan.

Tweak
-----

Tweak is an interactive scan that reads a field from one detector, displays
the result, and prompts the user to specify where to step the motor next.
It requires the setting ``gs.MASTER_DET`` (which detector to use,
such as ``sclr``) and ``MASTER_DET_FIELD`` (the name of the field in that
detector to read out, such as ``'sclr_chan4'``). Note that the former is a
readable object and the latter is a string of text.

.. code-block:: python

    tw(motor, step)
